Prerequisites:
 - whole source tree must be downloaded
 - rgb2565 must be built 
   - (from the tree root, "make rgb2565" and copy the resulting binary to somewhere in your $PATH)
   - (additionally, be sure that the lib64 directory in out/host/linux-x86 is copied to one level above wherever you put your rgb2565 binary)
 - imagemagick must be installed (sudo apt install imagemagick)

Process:
 - Create the picture you want as your initlogo (with dimensions 480 x 800, save it as reference.bmp)
 - run the command "convert reference.bmp reference.png"
 - run the command "convert -depth 8 -size 480x800 reference.png rgb:initlogo.raw"
 - run the command "rgb2565 -rle < initlogo.raw > initlogo.rle"
 - from the tree root, run "mka bootimage" after lunching fame, and boot the resulting image on your device
